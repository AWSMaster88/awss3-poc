Installing npm 
1. run

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash

2. Run
. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
3. Run: Installing Node.js also installs the Node Package Manager (npm), so you can install additional modules as needed.

nvm install --lts
4. Test that Node.js is installed and running correctly by typing the following at the command line.

node -e "console.log('Running Node.js ' + process.version)"

5. Install git

sudo yum -y install git




To generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for a Node.js project using CycloneDX, you can follow these steps:

Install CycloneDX CLI:

First, you need to install the CycloneDX CLI tool. You can install it using npm (Node Package Manager):

bash
Copy code
npm install --global @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm
Navigate to Your Node.js Project:

Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your Node.js project.

Generate CycloneDX SBOM:

Run the following command to generate a CycloneDX SBOM for your Node.js project:

bash
Copy code
cyclonedx-npm --output-file “bom.json”
This command will analyze your project's dependencies and generate an XML-based CycloneDX SBOM in the sbom.xml file.

/**pipy 
GitHub project: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-python
Slack channel: https://cyclonedx.slack.com/archives/CVA0QJEVA
Install the CycloneDX python plugin to your python project by running:
with pip:
pip install cyclonedx-bom
Run the below command:
for pip:
cyclonedx-py -pip --format json  -o bom.json
/**Maven
GitHub project: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-maven-plugin
Slack channel: https://cyclonedx.slack.com/archives/CVCKP34A2
Add the CycloneDX Maven plugin to your pom.xml:
maven
<plugins>
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.cyclonedx</groupId>
        <artifactId>cyclonedx-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.7.3</version>
    </plugin>
</plugins>


There are more configuration options (see the GitHub project for details). But the default should suffice for most cases.
Run the below command:
mvn org.cyclonedx:cyclonedx-maven-plugin:makeBom

Find the CycloneDX SBOM JSON under ./target
